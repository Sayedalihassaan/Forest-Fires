Project Title: Forest Fires Regression ML

Description:

This project investigates the relationships between various environmental factors and forest fire activity using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the severity or extent of forest fires based on relevant environmental data. This information can be valuable for forest management, early warning systems, and resource allocation.

Key Features:

Explores and analyzes a comprehensive dataset of forest fire and environmental data.
Employs various machine learning regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to model the relationship between fire behavior and environmental factors.
Compares and evaluates the performance of different regression models using appropriate metrics.
Provides clear visualizations and insights into the model's predictions and feature importance.
Offers potential real-world applications of the findings.
